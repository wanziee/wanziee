Welcome to my GitHub profile — where clean code meets creative chaos. By day, I’m a developer crafting digital experiences. By night… well, still a developer, but sometimes with a paintbrush in hand and Spotify blasting.

## 🚀 Technologies & Skills

<ul>
  <li><strong>Languages:</strong> TypeScript, JavaScript, PHP, Swift — a well-balanced tech diet to keep things interesting.</li>
  <li><strong>Frameworks:</strong> React, Laravel, SwiftUI — Whether it's web or mobile, I build interfaces that don't just work — they shine.</li>
  <li><strong>Databases:</strong> MySQL — giving data a cozy, relational home since forever 🏠.</li>
  <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Git, GitHub, Docker — most days, you’ll find me in the terminal, having conversations only developers understand 💻.</li>
</ul>

## 🎨 Hobbies

When the laptop lid closes (hypothetically), I dive into painting and sketching. There's something satisfying about creating things — whether it’s a slick UI or a moody landscape. Bonus points if it ends up impressing my cat. 🐱

## 🔒 Private Projects (Soon™)

1. **Gameload** – A game top-up website designed with style and speed. Because gamers deserve convenience too 🎮💸.
2. **Quizie** – A quiz app built in Swift that lets you test brains (yours or someone else's). Trivia has never looked this sleek 🧠✨.

And now, introducing the *real MVP* of my creative space...

She’s mysterious. She’s fierce. She has better posture than me after 12 hours of debugging. Meet the one and only:

> **"Cutest girl in ma room"** – The lady who silently judges your commit messages.

Fun fact: She only shows up when you skip unit tests or forget semicolons.
