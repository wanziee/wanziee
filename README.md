# Hi, I'm Wanzie! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile, where the magic of code meets the canvas of creativity. I'm a passionate developer by day and an artist by night (or, let's be honest, sometimes both at the same time).

## 🚀 Technologies & Skills

<ul>
  <li><strong>Languages:</strong> TypeScript, JavaScript, PHP, Swift — because I like my code as diverse as my coffee orders ☕.</li>
  <li><strong>Frameworks:</strong> React, Laravel — I promise I can make your app fly, or at least make it look like it is 🚀.</li>
  <li><strong>Databases:</strong> MySQL — I don't just store data, I give it a cozy home 🏠.</li>
  <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Git, GitHub, Docker — If you can't find me, check the terminal. I’m probably there, typing commands that make no sense to anyone else 💻.</li>
</ul>

## 🎨 Hobbies

When I’m not writing code, you can find me with a paintbrush in one hand and a sketchpad in the other. I believe in creativity — whether it's creating beautiful web apps or turning a blank canvas into something that might even impress my cat 🐱.

## 🔒 Private Projects (Shhh, They're Not Public... Yet)

1. **Gameload** - A website for game top-up, where gamers can recharge their accounts in style. Think of it as a convenience store, but for pixels and power-ups! 🎮💸
   
2. **Quizie** - An app I built in Swift to create quizzes on the go. It’s like having your very own trivia master in your pocket — without the annoying voice. 🧠💡
